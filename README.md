For enhancement three, I have selected a Java console application originally developed
during IT 145, Foundation in Application Development, as my artifact. This application was
created to manage a list of rescue animals for the Grazioso company, allowing the users to intake
new animals, reserve them for service, and view a list of available or reserved animals. This
application uses ArrayList<Dog> and ArrayList<Monkey> for in-memory data storage and
features a simple console-based menu interface to perform CRUD operations. The original
version of this application was functional but limited as it lacked data persistence, had minimal
filtering capabilities, and was not user-friendly or scalable.

I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it represents both the foundation of my
programming journey and how I have progressed and expanded my skills in more advanced
software development techniques and applications through the overhaul of my original artifact to
create a full-stack application. In the enhancement of this application, I have converted the
original console application into a full-stack web application, using Node.js, Express, MySQL,
with a web front end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I have replaced the
ArrayList structure with a MySQL database, building RESTful API endpoints to support all of
the original CRUD operations. These endpoints support dynamic querying, such as filtering by
species or reservation status, which was not an option in the original version.

The largest enhancement to this project is the inclusion of an interactive web interface
that includes form inputs for the animal intake process, additionally allowing for the filtering of
animals by species and status, using consistent data entry through dropdown input options, and
adding buttons for the reservation, update, and deletion of data entries. This enhancement
increases the usability and interactiveness of the database. In addition, I have included a
downloadable SQL file that allows the database to be recreated with sample data, which supports
portability and testing.

I built the project following a modular, full-stack, RESTful architecture that aligns with
industry best practices by separating the application into frontend, backend, and database layers.
I used industry techniques and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap on
the frontend; Node.js and Express on the backend; and MySQL for data storage. The backend is
structured around RESTful API routes using standard HTTP methods, enabling clean and
scalable interactions between components. The modular project layout was designed with clearly
separated folders for routes, controllers, and models, which further supports maintainability and
organization. These enhancements demonstrate my skills in both frontend and backend
development, database design, REST API implementation, and secure coding practices through
techniques such as input validation.

The enhancements made for this artifact met the course outcomes by designing a scalable
and maintainable database schema and using RESTful API routes, meeting course outcome three
in developing creative solutions using algorithmic principles and computer science practices. I
utilized industry standard tools and frameworks to deliver a professional and quality solution for
the Grazioso company, fulfilling course outcome four of demonstrating the use of well-rounded
and innovative techniques. Additionally, I incorporated data validation and consistency
techniques, mitigating potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, meeting outcome five of
developing a security mindset that ensures privacy and security.

While working on the enhancements for this project, I expanded my understanding of
full-stack architecture. Before starting, I had very limited experience with full-stack
development, having completed only one full-stack course prior to this course. This project
challenged me to dedicate extra time to relearning how front-end and back-end systems interact,
how RESTful APIs are structured, and how to integrate databases in a scalable way. Through the
process of implementing the planned enhancements, I learned how to manage data persistence
using MySQL, build asynchronous server logic with Node.js, and connect the backend to a
dynamic, web-based frontend.

One of the most important lessons that I took away was learning how to break down a
console-based application and restructure it into modular components that follow REST
principles. Additionally, translating the original Java logic into JavaScript, handling the
asynchronous operations in Express, and designing the frontend forms were challenging to
understand and implement with my limited knowledge. However, overcoming these challenges
strengthened my problem-solving skills, increased my understanding of full-stack development,
and taught me how to deliver practical, real-world solutions.
